@# Code Style ##

I don't wanna enforce any code style, so please see this
document more as a guideline to make the style of this
code more unique and on this way more easy to read. This
make write here more easy, cause a lot of people working
on this project.

### Braces ###

static char *
my_function(char* param1, char* param2)
{
    ...
}

if (condition) {
    ...
} else {
    ...
}

So, for function, the braces goes to the next line, everywhere
else, put it to the same line.

### Spaces/Taps ###

Not clear at this point - let's fine a solution.
